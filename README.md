Welcome to BCG’s Strategy Consulting Job Simulation! We’re so excited to have you here with us!


So what exactly is a job simulation? It is the perfect opportunity to take on practical tasks similar to what our very own BCGers would work on and get a true feel of what it is like to work at BCG as a strategy consultant, technology consultant, and a designer which will give you deeper understanding on what BCG does and help set you up for success when you decide to apply with us.

In this job simulation, we will gain enviable insight into what it’s like to solve meaningful challenges with our diverse and forward-thinking team. What’s great about our job simulation is the flexibility of it. We’ll get to choose the module or modules that you would like to take and complete all of these tasks and modules anywhere and anytime in the world, allowing you to upskill yourself in your own time and pace.

After finishing each module, we’ll be provided with real work sample answers from our leaders and you can see how top-tier consultants and our designers would have tackled each task, so that you can learn from their approach.

<h2><b>Task 1:</b></h2>
<hr>

We first task today is to do some research and identify markets in which handset leasing has already been introduced.

<b><h3>Here is a summary of the key definitions:</b></h3>
<br> 
<hr>

<b>Operating revenue</b>

Operating revenue is the revenue generated from a company's primary business activities. For example, a retailer produces revenue through merchandise sales, and a physician derives revenue from the medical services he/she provides.

<b>Operating expense</b>
An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations. Often abbreviated as OPEX, operating expenses include rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, payroll, insurance, step costs, and funds allocated for research and development

<b>EBITDA</b>
A company's Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization is an accounting measure calculated using a company's earnings, before interest expenses, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are subtracted, as a proxy for a company's current operating profitability.

<b>EBITDA Margins</b>
EBITDA margin is a measure of a company's operating profit as a percentage of its revenue. Knowing the EBITDA margin allows for a comparison of one company's real performance to others in its industry

<b>Depreciation and amortisation </b>
Depreciation refers to the reduction in the cost of the tangible fixed assets over its lifespan which is proportionate to the use of the asset in that specific year. 
Amortization refers to the reduction in the cost of the intangible assets over its lifespan. The key difference between amortization and depreciation is that amortization is used for intangible assets, while depreciation is used for tangible assets. ... Finally, because they are intangible, amortized assets do not have a salvage value, which is the estimated resale value of an asset at the end of its useful life.

<b>Net Finance Expense</b>
Net Financial Expense means the result of subtracting (i) the interests accrued by the Financial Debt during the relevant calculation period, minus (ii) the interests accrued by provisions made during the calculation period.

<b>Underlying profit</b>
Underlying profit is a calculation made internally by a company to show what it believes is a more accurate reflection of how much money it generates. The number focuses on regular accounting cycle events and often excludes one-time charges or infrequent occurrences.

<b>Net profit</b>
Net profit is the amount of money that is left after you subtract your total business expenses from your total revenue. In other words, it is a calculation that includes almost all financial transactions in your business.

<b>ARPU</b>
Average revenue per user (ARPU), sometimes known as average revenue per unit, is a measure used primarily by consumer communications, digital media, and networking companies, defined as the total revenue divided by the number of subscribers.

<b>Market Share</b>
Market share is the percentage of a market accounted for by a specific entity.

<b>Growth</b>
Market growth is the increase or decrease in the size of a market for a product or service over time. It is typically measured as the percentage change in total sales in an industry or product category

<b>Key comparable</b>
Comparable company analysis is the process of comparing companies based on similar metrics to determine their enterprise value. A company's valuation ratio determines whether it is overvalued or undervalued. If the ratio is high, then it is overvalued. If it is low, then the company is undervalued.

<b>Valuation ratios</b>
A valuation ratio shows the relationship between the market value of a company or its equity and some fundamental financial metric (e.g., earnings). The point of a valuation ratio is to show the price you are paying for some stream of earnings, revenue, or cash flow (or other financial metric).

<h3><b>Task 3: </b></h3>
<br>
<hr>

Elisse hands us a partially completed Excel model and some financial statements from the two companies, and asks us to complete the analysis. 

Within the workbook, Elisse has also added in a guiding sheet for us to follow. If we find ourself stuck, we may want to refer to the sheet for guidance on how to complete the tasks. There is also a list of the technical terms you learned in the previous exercise - in case we need to remind ourself. 

Here is our task:

<b>Task A:</b>
<br>
Analyse the data from Company A and Company B to determine the impact of leasing handsets on financial performance. State and apply your own assumptions, and identify the metrics we would use to perform a financial forecast for Company X.

<b>Task B</b>
<br>
Apply the metrics and performance impacts you have identified to forecast the upside in terms of the key metrics for Company X. To do this, first assume that Company X will grow at industry average, then assume it will grow at the same rate as Company A, which introduced leasing. Comparing the two forecasts will allows us to calculate the net impact of leasing.
