# BCG-Strategy-Consulting-Job-Simulation

Welcome to BCG’s Strategy Consulting Job Simulation! We’re so excited to have you here with us!


So what exactly is a job simulation? It is the perfect opportunity to take on practical tasks similar to what our very own BCGers would work on and get a true feel of what it is like to work at BCG as a strategy consultant, technology consultant, and a designer which will give you deeper understanding on what BCG does and help set you up for success when you decide to apply with us.

In this job simulation, we will gain enviable insight into what it’s like to solve meaningful challenges with our diverse and forward-thinking team. What’s great about our job simulation is the flexibility of it. We’ll get to choose the module or modules that you would like to take and complete all of these tasks and modules anywhere and anytime in the world, allowing you to upskill yourself in your own time and pace.

After finishing each module, we’ll be provided with real work sample answers from our leaders and you can see how top-tier consultants and our designers would have tackled each task, so that you can learn from their approach.

We first task today is to do some research and identify markets in which handset leasing has already been introduced.

Look for analyst reports on the impact on revenue and profits for the telecom companies operating in those markets, and summarise your findings in an email to Elisse, stating whether this is an attractive business model for the team to explore further.

Elisse has sent you a few reports that might be useful and shared the Minto Pyramid Principle to help you structure your response.
